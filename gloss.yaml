PARSING : The act of extracting specific data from a larger pool of data
INTERPOLATING : Calculating new data based on existing data
REAL NUMBER (aka FLOAT NUMBER) : A number that includes a decimal (for example 1.01). As computers can only represent data as binary there is a distinction with numbers due to possible rounding errors with real/floating point numbers.
INTEGER NUMBER : A number that does not include a decimal value (for example 12). As computers can only represent data in binary there is a greater reliability with math done with integers.
APPLICATION PROGRAMING INTERFACE (aka API) : A documented way to have code converse with other code
SEMANTIC : A basic pattern to any language that determines the structure of a statement.
SYNTACTIC SUGAR : Extensions to your code that allow for the code that is written to be more clear or conversational when read
